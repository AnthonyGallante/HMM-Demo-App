# üéØ HMM Demo Application - Presenter's Guide

A step-by-step walkthrough for demonstrating the Hidden Markov Model application to non-statistical audiences.

## üé¨ Pre-Demo Setup

### Before Your Presentation

1. **Test Everything**
   ```r
   source("setup_and_test.R")
   prepare_for_demo()
   ```

2. **Launch the Application**
   ```r
   source("run_app.R")
   ```

3. **Have Backup Plan**: Keep a few screenshots in case of technical issues

### Recommended Setup
- **Two monitors**: Application on one, presentation slides on the other
- **Large font sizes**: Ensure audience can read the interface
- **Stable internet**: If using RStudio Server
- **Backup data**: Have CSV files ready if example datasets fail

## üé™ Demo Flow

### Introduction (2-3 minutes)
**"Today I'll show you how to find hidden patterns in data without being a statistician."**

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Hidden patterns exist in all kinds of data (animal behavior, customer patterns, machine states)
- Traditional analysis only shows averages - HMMs find the underlying "modes"
- Our app makes this accessible to everyone

**Visual Hook:** 
*"Have you ever wondered why an animal sometimes moves fast, sometimes slow? Or why a customer is sometimes very active, sometimes quiet? These are hidden states!"*

## üìä Demo 1: Simple Animal Movement (5-7 minutes)

### Step 1: Load Data
- **Click**: "Example: Animal Movement (Haggis Data)"
- **Click**: "Load Data"

**Narration:** *"We're looking at GPS tracking data from a haggis - a small Scottish creature. We have x and y coordinates showing where it went."*

### Step 2: Configure Data
- **ID Column**: Should auto-select (explain this groups data by individual animals)
- **Observable Variables**: Select `x` and `y`
- **Covariates**: Leave empty for now
- **Click**: "Confirm Configuration"

**Narration:** *"We're telling the app we want to find patterns in the x and y movements. Each animal gets its own analysis."*
### Step 3: Configure Model  
- **States**: Keep at 2 (explain: "resting vs. active" or "slow vs. fast movement")
- **Click**: "Auto-Configure Model"

**Pause for effect** - let them see the automatic distribution detection

**Narration:** *"The app automatically figured out that these coordinates follow normal distributions and set up reasonable starting values. No PhD required!"*

- **Click**: "Confirm Model Setup"

### Step 4: Fit Model
- **Click**: "üöÄ Fit Model"

**While waiting (30 seconds):**
*"The computer is now finding the best way to separate our data into two hidden states. It's testing millions of possibilities to find the pattern that makes the most sense."*

### Step 5: Explore Results
**Once fitted:**
- **Point out**: AIC values ("lower is better - this is how we measure model quality")
- **Click**: "üîç Explore Detailed Results"

#### Key Visualizations:

1. **Distribution Plots**
   - **Click**: "üìä x" button
   - **Explain**: "Look! State 1 animals tend to have x-coordinates around [value], while State 2 animals are around [value]. They're in different locations!"
   
2. **Time Series Plot**
   - **Click**: "üìà Time Series Plot" 
   - **Primary Variable**: x, **Secondary**: y
   - **Click**: "üìà Time Series Plot"
   - **Explain**: "The colors show when the animal was in each state. See how it switches between behaviors over time?"

**Key Message:** *"Without us telling it anything about animal behavior, the computer discovered that this animal has two distinct movement patterns!"*

## ü¶å Demo 2: Complex Movement Data with Covariates (8-10 minutes)

### Reset and Load New Data
- **Navigate**: Back to "1. Load Data" (or use the üîÑ Reset button)
- **Select**: "Example: Muskox Movement Data"
- **Click**: "Load Data"

**Narration:** *"Now let's try something more complex - movement data from muskoxen with environmental covariates that might influence their behavior patterns."*

### Configure Data
- **ID Column**: Will auto-select 
- **Observable Variables**: Select `step` (step length) and `angle` (turning angle)
- **Covariates**: Select environmental variables like `elevation_scaled` and `airtemp_scaled`
- **Click**: "Confirm Configuration"

**Explain Covariates:** *"Environmental factors like elevation and temperature might influence when muskoxen switch between movement behaviors - like foraging vs. traveling patterns."*

### Configure Model
- **States**: Try 3 states ("low, medium, high temperature periods")
- **Click**: "Auto-Configure Model"
- **Click**: "Confirm Model Setup"

### Fit and Explore
- **Fit the model** (explain the wait)
- **Generate visualizations**:

1. **Distribution Plot for Temperature**
   - **Show**: How each state has different temperature ranges
   - **Narrate**: "State 1 is cold days, State 2 is mild, State 3 is hot!"

2. **Covariate Effects**
   - **Select**: Wind from dropdown
   - **Click**: "üìä State Probabilities"
   - **Explain**: "This shows how wind speed affects whether it's a hot or cold day!"
   
   - **Click**: "üîÑ Transition Probabilities"  
   - **Explain**: "This shows what wind conditions trigger changes from hot to cold weather!"

**Key Message:** *"The model learned that wind and month don't just correlate with temperature - they actually predict when temperature patterns will switch!"*

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Demo 3: Physiological Data with Daily Rhythms (Optional, 5-7 minutes)

### Load Fitbit Heart Rate Data
- **Navigate**: Back to "1. Load Data"
- **Select**: "Example: Fitbit Heart Rate Data"
- **Click**: "Load Data"

**Narration:** *"Now let's look at something completely different - heart rate data from a Fitbit device. This shows how Hidden Markov Models can find patterns in any time series data, even physiological measurements."*

### Configure Data
- **ID Column**: Will auto-select
- **Observable Variables**: Select `Value` (heart rate)
- **Covariates**: Select `TimeOfDay` 
- **Click**: "Confirm Configuration"

**Explain the Context:** *"We're looking at heart rate throughout the day. The model will try to find different 'states' - maybe resting heart rate vs. active periods. The time of day might influence when these states occur."*

### Configure and Fit Model
- **States**: Try 2 states ("resting vs. active heart rate")
- **Click**: "Auto-Configure Model" 
- **Note**: The app automatically recognizes this as heart rate data and sets realistic parameters
- **Click**: "Confirm Model Setup"
- **Fit the model**

### Explore Results
1. **Distribution Plot for Heart Rate**
   - **Show**: Clear separation between resting (~70 bpm) and active (~100 bpm) heart rates
   - **Narrate**: "Look! The model discovered two distinct heart rate patterns without us telling it anything about physiology!"

2. **Time Series Plot**
   - **Show**: How heart rate states change throughout the day
   - **Explain**: "You can see periods of sustained low heart rate (probably sleeping or resting) and bursts of higher heart rate (activity periods)."

3. **Observation Parameters Plot** (Advanced Feature)
   - **Select**: TimeOfDay from covariate dropdown
   - **Click**: "üìà Observation Parameters"
   - **Show**: How heart rate parameters follow daily rhythms
   - **Explain**: "This advanced plot shows how both the average heart rate AND the variability change throughout the day following natural circadian patterns!"

**Key Message:** *"Hidden Markov Models aren't just for animals or weather - they work on any data with hidden patterns, including human physiology! And with advanced features, we can model complex daily rhythms."*

## üéØ Interactive Segment (3-5 minutes)

### Audience Participation
**Ask the audience:**
- "What do you think would happen if we tried 4 states instead of 3?"
- "What other variables might influence these patterns?"

### Live Exploration
Based on audience suggestions:
- Try different numbers of states
- Look at a different variable
- Upload their data if they brought any

### Common Audience Questions:
- **"How does it know when to switch states?"** 
  *Answer: It learns probabilities - like "when temperature is rising and wind is low, there's a 70% chance we'll switch to the hot state."*

- **"Could this work on business data?"**
  *Answer: Absolutely! Customer behavior, machine states, market conditions - anywhere you have hidden patterns.*

- **"What if the model is wrong?"**
  *Answer: That's what the diagnostic plots are for - they help us check if the model makes sense.*

## üéâ Wrap-Up (2-3 minutes)

### Key Takeaways
1. **"Hidden patterns exist everywhere"** - in your data too
2. **"You don't need statistics training"** - the app handles the complexity
3. **"Visual results are interpretable"** - anyone can understand the plots
4. **"Applicable to many domains"** - not just animals or weather

### Next Steps for Audience
- **"Try it yourself"** - app is available for download
- **"Start simple"** - begin with 2 states, no covariates
- **"Focus on interpretation"** - the plots tell a story
- **"Iterate and explore"** - try different configurations

### Common Follow-up Questions

**Q: "How do I know how many states to use?"**
A: Start with 2, then try 3, 4. Compare AIC values - lower is better. Also check if the states make biological/practical sense.

**Q: "What if my data is different?"**
A: The app auto-detects distributions. As long as you have continuous measurements or counts, it should work.

**Q: "How accurate is this?"**
A: Check the residual plots! They tell you if the model fits well. Also, cross-validate with domain knowledge.

**Q: "Can I use this for my business/research?"**
A: Yes! HMMs work for customer states, machine conditions, biological processes, market regimes, etc.

## üõü Troubleshooting During Demo

### If the App Crashes
- **Stay calm**: "Let me restart - this happens sometimes with live demos!"
- **Have screenshots**: Show pre-generated results
- **Backup plan**: Discuss the concepts without the live demo

### If Model Fitting Fails
- **Try fewer states**: "Let's try 2 states instead"
- **Different dataset**: Switch to a simpler example
- **Acknowledge**: "Real data can be tricky - this is why we test different approaches!"

### If Audience Seems Lost
- **Slow down**: Focus on one visualization at a time
- **Ask questions**: "What do you see in this plot?"
- **Use analogies**: Compare to familiar concepts

### If Technical Questions Get Deep
- **Redirect**: "That's a great advanced question - let's discuss after the demo"
- **Stay focused**: "The beauty is you don't need to understand the math to use it"
- **Acknowledge expertise**: "For those who want the technical details, I'm happy to discuss after"

## üé¨ Presentation Tips

### Verbal Techniques
- **Pause after key points**: Let insights sink in
- **Use inclusive language**: "We can see..." not "You should see..."
- **Build suspense**: "Let's see what the computer discovered..."
- **Celebrate discoveries**: "Look at that! The model found two clear patterns!"

### Physical Presence
- **Stand where everyone can see**: Don't block the screen
- **Point specifically**: Use cursor or laser pointer precisely  
- **Face the audience**: Talk to them, not the screen
- **Move purposefully**: Don't pace randomly

### Handling Mistakes
- **Own them quickly**: "Oops, let me fix that"
- **Use them as teaching moments**: "This is why we always double-check our settings"
- **Stay confident**: Technical glitches don't reflect on the science
